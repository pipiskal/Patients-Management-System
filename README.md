# Patients-Management-System

--THE PROJECT IS STILL UNDER CONSTUCTION--ITS NOT FINISHED YET


A django project that u can can do crud operations over Patient models

-first of all all the information that exists on the screenshots are random and doenst correspond to real people or any other details.

-Since i am new to programing world you are going to find a lot of bugs and code to be refactored but its my first try to undestand 
the concepts of python and the django framework

The goal of this project is:

-To learn crud functionallity like add, delete, create and update new patients
-To be able to understand relations between django models, manytomany one to many and onetoone
-To be able to query the database and understand the sql queries that are running at the background
-Understand the functionaliy of the models as python classes and how they become database tables
-How to design the database, are we going to have abstract models?? and what we need in general
-To work with forms and learn the basic concepts of html
-to work with Model forms and how to edit already created instances of a model
-To understand authentication and authoraziation , how to raise validations errors and how they appear on browser
-How to style forms 
-To learn views and how to handle the flow from request to url to view to get data and finally render a temlate
-Experiment with static files
-learn the very basics of css to create a simple styling 
-How to handle data what datastructures we can use ----> ofc my approach is not the best and for sure needs to be improved


What comes Next:

-need to work with sessions 
-Understand cookies
-How chaching works in Django 
-creating rest api
-possible convert the project to an api with DJANGO_REST_FRAMEWORK

--and a lot more that will come to mind***
